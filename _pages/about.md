<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->


I am first year Computer Science and Informatics PhD student at <a href='https://www.emory.edu/home/index.html'>Emory University</a>. I previously conducted medical-AI research at <a href='https://www.mskcc.org/'>Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center</a>  and  <a href='https://www.brighamandwomens.org/'>Brigham and Women's Hospital</a> where I built deep-learning models that extract quantitative biomarkers from clinical imaging to improve cancer risk prediction, treatment planning, and patient outcomes. 

I have a B.S. in Interdisciplinary Data Science from <a href='https://www.duke.edu/'>Duke University</a> and  <a href='https://dukekunshan.edu.cn/zh'>Duke Kunshan University</a> .
