  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Pediatric glioma recurrence can cause morbidity and
              mortality; however, recurrence patterns and severity are
              heterogeneous and challenging to predict with established
              clinical and genomic markers. As a result, almost all children
              undergo frequent, long-term, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
              brain surveillance regardless of individual recurrence risk.
              Longitudinal deep-learning analysis of serial MRI scans may be an
              effective approach for improving individualized recurrence
              prediction in gliomas and other cancers, but, thus far, progress
              has been limited by data availability and current
              machine-learning approaches. METHODS: We developed a
              self-supervised temporal deep-learning approach tailored for
              longitudinal medical imaging analysis, wherein a multistep model
              encodes patients' serial MRI scans and is trained to classify the
              correct chronological order as a pretext task. The pretrained
              model is then fine-tuned to predict the primary end point of
              interest - in this case, 1-year recurrence prediction for
              pediatric gliomas from the point of last scan - by leveraging a
              patient's historical postoperative surveillance scans. We apply
              the model across 3994 scans from 715 patients followed at three
              separate institutions in the setting of pediatric low- and
              high-grade gliomas. RESULTS: Longitudinal imaging analysis with
              temporal learning improved recurrence prediction performance (F1
              score) by up to 58.5\% (range, 6.6 to 58.5\%) compared with
              traditional approaches across datasets, with performance
              improvements in both low- and high-grade gliomas and area under
              the receiver operating characteristic curve of (range, 75 to
              89\%) across all datasets. Recurrence prediction performance
              increased incrementally with the number of historical scans
              available per patient, reaching plateaus between three and six
              scans, depending on the dataset. CONCLUSIONS: Temporal deep
              learning enables high-performing longitudinal medical imaging
              analysis and point-of-care decision support for pediatric brain
              tumors. Temporal learning may be broadly adaptable to track and
              predict risk in patients with other cancers and chronic diseases
              undergoing surveillance imaging. (Funded in part by the National

              imaging (MRI) has the potential to improve disease diagnosis and
              management but requires algorithms with generalizable knowledge
              that can perform well in a variety of clinical scenarios. The
              field has been constrained, thus far, by limited training data
              and task-specific models that do not generalize well across
              patient populations and medical tasks. Foundation models, by
              leveraging self-supervised learning, pretraining, and targeted
              adaptation, present a promising paradigm to overcome these
              limitations. Here, we present Brain Imaging Adaptive Core
              (BrainIAC), a novel foundation model designed to learn
              generalized representations from unlabeled brain MRI data and
              serve as a core basis for diverse downstream application
              adaptation. Trained and validated on 48,519 brain MRIs across a
              broad spectrum of tasks, we demonstrate that BrainIAC outperforms
              localized supervised training and other pretrained models,
              particularly in low-data settings and high-difficulty tasks,
              allowing for application in scenarios otherwise infeasible.
              BrainIAC can be integrated into imaging pipelines and multimodal
              frameworks and may lead to improved biomarker discovery and AI
              clinical translation.",
